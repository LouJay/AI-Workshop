# A Spatio-Temporal Residual Network for Deep Fake Anti-Spoofing

> By Seyed Ali Miraftabzadeh, Arun Das, Paul Rad

## Abstract
With IoT proliferation, a decentralized biometric
Access Control System (ACS) is crucial to ensure identity
consistency in cyber physical space. In this paper, a biometric
secure modality is proposed based on temporal domain that
is often captured by IoT systems. A novel neural network
architecture, consisting of ResNet blocks and Long Short-Term
Memory (LSTM), is proposed to learn the temporal dynamics
of human biometrics, such as face, in uncontrolled environment
(typical of many real-world scenarios). The model is designed to
support multi device-embedded implementation to keep reference
data securely distributed on IoT devices in the form of biometric
tokens for decentralized cooperative anti-spoofing, and 94.7%
accuracy are achieved on YouTube Faces dataset. A time series
analysis of these embeddings using Chebyshev distance is carried
out to deter spoofing attacks such as video-replay by finding
the dominant facial feature distribution from a ground truth
reference. The distribution of data, which are not within the
accepted error tolerance would be considered as fake data.
The results presented on YouTube Faces dataset, as well as
our in-house dataset, are promising to prevent tampering and
spoofing unauthorized access for both real-time on-line and offline
identification in decentralized biometrics IoT.
